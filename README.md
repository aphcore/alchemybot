If you use parts of this script for your free script please credit me. (Link GitHub Repository)

In-game instructions:

If you do not know how to install a MacroMod script then this free script isn't for you.
I do not provide support on my free scripts. (Unless you can catch me on a good day :P)

Do "/SetSpawn" next to a brewing stand, chest full of water bottles, and a trash area to throw things into the void.
Next, put enchanted cane and wart into your inventory with at least 4 empty slots. (The script will stop after it has used all E-SCane and Netherwart)
Finally, execute the script.

Made in 2 hours, if you have any suggestions please join the "support" server. :)
