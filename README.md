# aph Alchemy
Alchemy script for Hypixel Skyblock.


```
Usage instructions: (Assuming previous knowledge of MacroMod)

1. Download the main .txt file.
2. Drag it in to your minecraftdirectory\liteconfig\common\macros
3. In-game bind $${exec(aphalchemy.txt,"APH_ALCHEMY")}$$ to a key. (Starts the script)
4. Bind $${stop(all)}$$ to a key. (Stops all running scripts)
5. Press whatever key you bound in step 3.

Do "/setspawn" next to a brewing stand, chest full of water bottles, and a trash area to throw things into the void.
Next, put enchanted cane and wart into your inventory with at least 4 empty slots. (The script will stop after it has used all Enchanted Sugar Cane and Netherwart)
Finally, execute the script.
```
